# Hackathon-revv
This project is a demonstration of how revvsales apis are helping to make the workflow of an educational institute easy.

Top talented tutorials (T3) is an educational institute that provides comprehensive notes on various subjects. 
We use revvsale services heavily in our workflow for various things. For example:
- [x] storing the notes (lecture note documents)
- [x] maintaining contacts of students and
- [x] also for keeping track of potential candidates.
## Available Scripts

All this is done through the apis provided by revvsales.
In this project we have created a react app that calls the apis on different action triggers. Hope you like it!
